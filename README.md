# 🔁 Customer Churn Prediction App

An interactive Streamlit web app to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on key features like age, gender, tenure, and monthly charges. Built with machine learning and deployed for real-time inference.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Predicts churn using a trained classification model
- 🧠 Uses features: `Age`, `Gender`, `Tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`
- 🔍 Shows probability of churn with clear messaging
- ✅ Built using Streamlit, scikit-learn, pandas, and joblib
